Shade lifted his head and sniffed the air. He looked human except for his crimson hair
and maroon eyes.
He blinked in surprise. The message had been correct: they were here. Or was it a trap?
He weighed the odds, then said icily, “Spread out; hide behind trees and bushes. Stop
whoever is coming . . . or die.”
Around him shuffled twelve Urgals with short swords and round iron shields painted with
black symbols. They resembled men with bowed legs and thick, brutish arms made for
crushing. A pair of twisted horns grew above their small ears. The monsters hurried into
the brush, grunting as they hid. Soon the rustling quieted and the forest was silent again.
The Shade peered around a thick tree and looked up the trail. It was too dark for any
human to see, but for him the faint moonlight was like sunshine streaming between the
trees; every detail was clear and sharp to his searching gaze. He remained unnaturally
quiet, a long pale sword in his hand. A wire-thin scratch curved down the blade. The
weapon was thin enough to slip between a pair of ribs, yet stout enough to hack through
the hardest armor.
The Urgals could not see as well as the Shade; they groped like blind beggars, fumbling
with their weapons. An owl screeched, cutting through the silence. No one relaxed until
the bird flew past. Then the monsters shivered in the cold night; one snapped a twig with
his heavy boot. The Shade hissed in anger, and the Urgals shrank back, motionless. He
suppressed his distaste—they smelled like fetid meat—and turned away. They were tools,
nothing more.
The Shade forced back his impatience as the minutes became hours. The scent must have
wafted far ahead of its owners. He did not let the Urgals get up or warm themselves. He
denied himself those luxuries, too, and stayed behind the tree, watching the trail. Another
gust of wind rushed through the forest. The smell was stronger this time. Excited, he
lifted a thin lip in a snarl.
“Get ready,” he whispered, his whole body vibrating. The tip of his sword moved in
small circles. It had taken many plots and much pain to bring himself to this moment. It
would not do to lose control now.
Eyes brightened under the Urgals’ thick brows, and the creatures gripped their weapons
tighter. Ahead of them, the Shade heard a clink as something hard struck a loose stone.
Faint smudges emerged from the darkness and advanced down the trail.
Three white horses with riders cantered toward the ambush, their heads held high and
proud, their coats rippling in the moonlight like liquid silver.
On the first horse was an elf with pointed ears and elegantly slanted eyebrows. His build
was slim but strong, like a rapier. A powerful bow was slung on his back. A sword
pressed against his side opposite a quiver of arrows fletched with swan feathers.
The last rider had the same fair face and angled features as the other. He carried a long
spear in his right hand and a white dagger at his belt. A helm of extraordinary
craftsmanship, wrought with amber and gold, rested on his head.
Between these two rode a raven-haired elven lady, who surveyed her surroundings with
poise. Framed by long black locks, her deep eyes shone with a driving force. Her clothes
were unadorned, yet her beauty was undiminished. At her side was a sword, and on her
back a long bow with a quiver. She carried in her lap a pouch that she frequently looked
at, as if to reassure herself that it was still there.
One of the elves spoke quietly, but the Shade could not hear what was said. The lady
answered with obvious authority, and her guards switched places. The one wearing the
helm took the lead, shifting his spear to a readier grip. They passed the Shade’s hiding
place and the first few Urgals without suspicion.
The Shade was already savoring his victory when the wind changed direction and swept
toward the elves, heavy with the Urgals’ stench. The horses snorted with alarm and
tossed their heads. The riders stiffened, eyes flashing from side to side, then wheeled
their mounts around and galloped away."
